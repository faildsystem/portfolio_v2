## Overview

Tajawul is my graduation project, an **AI-driven travel assistant** designed to make traveling across the **Arab World** more accessible, culturally immersive, and socially connected. It combines **real-time translation**, a **culture-specific chatbot**, **personalized recommendations**, and **social connectivity** to bridge the gap between travelers and their destinations.

## Key Features

### üî§ Real-Time Translation
- Breaks language barriers with **Arabic dialect support**.
- Enables travelers to communicate naturally with locals.


### ü§ñ Culture-Specific Chatbot (Rafiq)
- Provides **context-aware answers** about traditions, etiquette, and destinations.
- Built on **Aya Expanse 8B** with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


### üéí Recommendation System
- **Hybrid AI model** combining collaborative + content-based filtering.
- Suggests destinations, itineraries, and events tailored to user interests.


### üó∫Ô∏è TripHub & Social Connectivity
- Share and clone itineraries.
- Social feed with posts, reviews, and group chats.
- Built-in translation in chats for multi-language travelers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, Neo4j, MongoDb
- **Frontend**: Next.js (Web), Flutter (Mobile)
- **AI/ML**: Seamless M4T (Translation), Aya Expanse 8B (Chatbot), Hybrid Recommender System
- **Deployment**: Azure VM for Machine Learning Models & Backend, Vercel for web 

## üèÜ Impact
Tajawul bridges **language, culture, and planning gaps** for travelers in the Arab World. By combining AI and social features, it creates an **immersive travel experience** where tourists:
- Communicate naturally.
- Understand local culture.
- Plan personalized trips.
- Connect with like-minded explorers.

## ‚ö° Challenges and Learnings
- **Data Complexity**: Handling diverse Arabic dialects required advanced preprocessing and augmentation.
- **AI Model Limitations**: Training a seq2seq model from scratch revealed constraints in data availability and computational power.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Ensuring chatbot responses were contextually accurate and respectful taught us the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets.
- **Deployment Hurdles**: Setting up scalable ML services with Docker and Azure required mastering DevOps practices.
- **Team Collaboration**: Using agile and incremental development highlighted the value of continuous feedback and modular design.

## üéì Outcome
Tajawul successfully demonstrates how **AI can enhance tourism in the Arab World** by addressing **language, culture, and social interaction challenges**. The platform:
- Delivers **real-time, dialect-aware translations**.
- Provides a **culturally relevant chatbot assistant**.
- Recommends **personalized itineraries** using hybrid AI models.
- Encourages **social engagement** among travelers.
